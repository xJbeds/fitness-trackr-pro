// 6. Build a new component to use as the page for details about a single activity.
// Each activity in <ActivityList> should link to its own page.
// On that page, the activity's name, description, and creator name should be displayed.
// That component should use useQuery to grab information about the single activity from the API.
// Hint: define the activity ID as a dynamic segment so the component can grab the ID with useParams!
